# References
An iPad app that helps me keep photo references organized. I use it mainly while sculpting.

## Build
- Open References.xcodeproj on XCode (it was tested with version 7.2).
- Open Flickr.swift, find the API_KEY constant and paste your Flickr API key inside the string.
- Build and Run.

## Usage
The main screen shows your list of boards. There you can create a new board by pressing the + button, remove boards by pressing the edit button or viewing a board by pressing its name.

On the board screen you can view and navigate among your images. To add images to the board, simply press the + button and a screen where you can search Flickr for images will be shown. When you find images that you like select them by pressing on the desired images and press done. That is it, your selected images are now on your board.
